# Objects Part One Practice

1. Create a function that render information about a movie, destructure the movie object in the argument list so that the . ( dot ) operator is not needed, after that render the movie in the html.

```
const movie = {
    title: "Saving Private Ryan"
    director: "Steven Spielberg",
    country: "USA"
    year: 1999
    productionInfo: {
        budget: "70 million",
        producer: "Ian Bryce",
    }
}
```

2. Given the below arrays, combine them all to create one main array caleed `plants`, the order is up to the student

```
const fruits = ['apples', 'oranges', 'lemons']

const vegetables = ['broccoli', 'carrots', 'cabbage']

const nuts = ['peanuts', 'almonds', 'walnuts', 'hazelnuts']
```
