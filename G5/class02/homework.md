Movies renting App
Create a movie renting app
There should be an array of movie names
There should be an input and a search button
When the person enters a name of a movie it should search the array
If the name exists it should show an H1 element that says: "The movie can be rented" in green text
If the name does not exist it should show an H1 element that says: "The movie can't be rented" in red text
The input should not be case sensitive ( it should find the movie regardless of capital or small letters )
