## Exercise 1
  Make 3 anonymous functions (function expressions)

  Function that takes a number through a parameter and returns how many digits that number has\
  Function that takes a number through a parameter and returns if its even or odd\
  Function that takes a number through a parameter and returns if its positive or negative


  BONUS: Create a function that takes a number through a parameter and calls all three functions for the number that was passed. It should show the results in the console.
  Ex:
  Code: getNumberStats(-25); Console: 2 Digits, Odd, Negative

## Exercise 2
  Create a function that takes a string and returns the number (count) of vowels contained within it. (Use anonymous functions/Arrow functions for the implementation)

  Ex:
  Code: countVowels("Pineapple"); Console: 4 vowels

  BONUS: Provide the input from the HTML, and print the result on the HTML.
