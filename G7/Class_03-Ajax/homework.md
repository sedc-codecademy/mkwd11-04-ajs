## Exercise 1
 - Create a function that makes api call to the url: "https://swapi.dev/api/people"
 - After you retrieve the data print the first character in the HTML.
 - Example: 
   - Character Name: Luke Skywalker
   - Character Height: 172
   - Character BirthYear: 19BBY

## Exercise 2
  - Create a function that makes api call to the url "https://swapi.dev/api/planets"
  - After the data is retrived print the planets on the HTML

## BONUS: Exercise 3
  - Find out in the documentation how can you request for "specific character resource"
  - Using that url, make API request to get the data
  - After you get the data, create a function that is going to print it in the HTML the properties: "birth_year, eye_color, name, homeworld"
  - IMPORTANT: the property homeworld, should be informations of the homeworld not the url ;)
  - HINT: You would have to do, a api request with the homeworld property value to retrieve it's infomartion.

### The bonus is not mendatory =)
